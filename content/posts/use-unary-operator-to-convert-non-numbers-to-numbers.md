title: "Use Unary Operator to Convert Non Numbers to Numbers"

The *unary plus (+)* operator precedes its operand and evaluates to its operand but attempts to convert it into a number, if it isn't already.

>Although *unary negation (-)* also can convert non-numbers, unary plus is the fastest and preferred way of converting something into a number, because it does not perform any other operations on the number. It can convert string representations of integers and floats, as well as the non-string values `true, false, and null`. Integers in both decimal and hexadecimal (0x-prefixed) formats are supported. Negative numbers are supported (though not for hex). Using the operator on BigInt values throws a TypeError. If it cannot parse a particular value, it will evaluate to NaN.

## Examples

### Usage with numbers

```javascript

const x = 1;
const y = -1;

console.log(+x);
// 1
console.log(+y);
// -1

```

### Usage with non-numbers

```javascript

+true  // 1
+false // 0
+null  // 0
+function (val) { return val; } // NaN
+1n    // throws TypeError: Cannot convert BigInt value to number

```
