# CloudStack Virtual Router Overview

## In CloudStack:

**Isolated Networks** and **VPCs** depend on a **Virtual Router (VR)** for all **external (north-south) connectivity**.

Without a VR:

- VMs can still talk to each other within the same network (L2/L3 via bridge)
- But they **cannot reach outside**, and **nothing external can reach them** (no NAT, no DHCP, no gateway, no DNS)

---

## Why?

Because in both **isolated networks** and **VPCs**, the **VR acts as**:

- Default gateway for VMs  
- DHCP server (VMs wonâ€™t even get IPs without it)  
- DNS forwarder  
- NAT/firewall/VPN endpoint  
- Router for public traffic
