I’ve been part of the [**Apache CloudStack**](https://cloudstack.apache.org/) community for some time, contributing across projects — most notably building the **CloudStack Terraform provider** during *Google Summer of Code*.  
You can read more about that work in my [final GSoC report](/posts/GSoC-2022-final-report-daman-arora) or [watch my presentation from the CloudStack Collaboration Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdA2epTfu7k).

[**ShapeBlue**](https://www.shapeblue.com/) has long been one of the driving forces behind the CloudStack ecosystem — known for its engineering excellence, community leadership, and genuine commitment to open-source values.  
What makes it even more special is that it’s an *employee-owned company*, where every engineer has a real stake in the success of both the business and the open-source projects we support.

As I prepare to start this new chapter, I wanted to share a few reasons I’m especially excited about joining ShapeBlue:

### Deep Open-Source Impact
I’ve contributed to many open projects, but few communities are as collaborative and technically rigorous as CloudStack’s.  
ShapeBlue’s central role in driving that ecosystem makes it the perfect place to grow.

### Engineering Culture
The team is filled with people who’ve been building, scaling, and maintaining real production clouds for years.  
It’s a rare mix of humility, depth, and hands-on expertise.

### Ownership Mindset
The employee-ownership model truly resonated with me — a company where every engineer is an owner feels like the right environment to build meaningful, lasting software.

Joining ShapeBlue feels like a **natural next step** — a chance to work alongside the people who’ve helped shape CloudStack’s direction for years, and to contribute to open-source infrastructure I genuinely believe in.
